What are 3 common interview questions and suggestions for how to answer them well
Here are three commonly asked interview questions and some tips on how to answer them effectively:

"Tell me about yourself."

What they’re looking for: A concise summary of your background, skills, and how they relate to the role.

How to answer: Focus on your professional journey while aligning it with the job. For example: Start with your current or most recent position. Mention key achievements, relevant skills, and why you're excited about this role. Keep it brief—about 1-2 minutes.

Example: "I'm a software developer with five years of experience specializing in front-end development. At my last job, I led a project that improved site speed by 30%, and I enjoy creating user-friendly designs. I'm especially interested in this role because it focuses on building scalable and impactful web applications."

"What is your greatest strength and weakness?"

What they’re looking for: Honesty and self-awareness. Employers want to see if you're a good fit and working on self-improvement.

How to answer:

Strength: Highlight a quality tied to the role, along with a quick example.

Weakness: Pick something you're working to improve and show your progress.

Example: "One of my strengths is my adaptability—I’ve often taken on new responsibilities when a project required it, such as learning new software quickly. As for my weakness, I used to struggle with public speaking, but I've been taking workshops and volunteering to present at team meetings to improve."

"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

What they’re looking for: Ambition and alignment with the company’s growth.

How to answer: Share a vision of growth that relates to the position and shows loyalty to the company.

Example: "In five years, I see myself having grown into a leadership role where I can contribute to strategic decision-making while continuing to enhance my technical expertise. I'm excited about the growth opportunities this company offers, and I’d love to contribute to its success over the long term."
